# Flavor-of-the-Day-List
To run this program download the zip file and run the main.py file.

Disclaimer: This program was made early in my coding career, and I am just uploading it now. It is for the most part unfinished and there are many issues with it. This is not reflective of my current coding ability.
Maybe I will get some free time and rewrite it and see if I can make it work more cleanly.
However it still does its job.

So what is the program's job?
This was written as a small personal project to aid in office work at a Culver's franchise. 
At every Culver's franchise, there is a new Flavor of the Day every day, which is just a chosen list of different flavors that changes day by day.
I was tasked with making this list for every month.
The list has a couple conditions it needs to meet, so I thought it would be fun to try to make a program do it for me.
These conditions are that the flavors need to alternate through a vanilla base, then an extract base (anything other than vanilla or chocolate), then a chocolate base, and then another extract base. 
Additionally, there cannot be a flavor with similar toppings within a couple days of each other. So, for example, two different flavors that both have Reeses cannot be within two days of each other. 
Also, no flavor can repeat. 
So I thought it would be fun to make a program to make the list for me!

Go ahead and try it out!
